# VantaGate 
The simplest way to browse the internet, download and open web pages and files anonymously. Only takes up 18KB of storage, and can be used to bypass parental restrictions such as Clever, Securely, Google Family Link, and Apple's Screen Time for Safari. 

## DISCLAIMER: 
This tool allows you to download and open content anonymously. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that the content you are downloading is safe. We do not control the files you access through this tool, and we are not responsible for any harm caused by malicious files.

## Guide: 
- Open index.html.
- Paste link into Fetch and click the 'Fetch' button.
- Right click the link and select 'Save Link' or 'Download Linked File'.
- Copy the file directory, if it is a webpage (ends in '.html').
- Paste file directory into Open, and click the 'Open' button.

### List of webpages that work for search engine indexing (in substitute for Google, which doesn't work):

- Bing (URL: "https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=123&q=your+query+here")
- Ecosia (URL: "https://ecosia.org/search?q=your+query+here")
- Yandex (more instructions below)
- Brave (URL: "https://search.brave.com/search?q=your+query+here")

I am sure there is more, but these are the only ones that I know of so far that work with this project.  

#### More info on Bing URL 

**"https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=123&q=your+query+here"**

The '123' in the URL above means any number you choose would work when fetching.

#### How to use Yandex with VantaGatae 

To use Yandex:
- Fetch the url (https://yandex.com)
- Open the '.html' file using your native browser or VantaGate
- Type in your search term and hit enter
- If your browser says 'Site Blocked', 'Access Restricted', etc, copy the link from the search bar and fetch that one as well
- Open the other '.html' file using either your native browser or VantaGate


### Please use this tool responsibly.
